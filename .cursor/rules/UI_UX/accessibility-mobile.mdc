# Accessibility & Mobile Standards

## 📱 Mobile Interaction (The "Thumb Zone" Law)

Mobile users should never struggle to tap a button.

* **Touch Targets:**
  * **Rule:** All interactive elements must have a hit area of at least `44x44px`.
  * **Fix:** If a visual icon is small (e.g., `w-4 h-4`), use a wrapper padding: `p-3` or `-m-2 p-2` to increase the hit area without changing the visual size.
* **Reachability:**
  * Place primary actions (Save, Continue) at the *bottom* of the screen on mobile (within easy thumb reach).
  * Use `sticky bottom-0` for mobile action bars.

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

"Luxury" does not mean "Low Contrast".

* **Contrast Ratio:**
  * Ensure text-to-background contrast is at least **4.5:1**.
  * *Warning:* Be careful with `text-zinc-500` on `bg-zinc-900`. If it's too dark, bump it to `text-zinc-400`.
* **Focus States:**
  * Never use `outline-none` without replacing it with a custom focus ring.
  * *Standard:* `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white/20 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-black`.
* **Semantic HTML:**
  * Use `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation.
  * Never use `<div onClick={...}>`.

## ⚡ Performance (Core Web Vitals)

* **Images:**
  * Always use `alt` tags.
  * Use `priority` on the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image (usually the Hero image).
* **Layout Shift (CLS):**
  * Always define `aspect-ratio` or fixed `h-` classes for images/skeletons to prevent layout jumping when loading.
