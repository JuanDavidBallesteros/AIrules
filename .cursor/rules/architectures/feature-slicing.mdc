# Vertical Slicing (Feature-First)

**Principle:** Locate code by **what it does** (Feature), not **what it is** (Controller/Service).

## 1. The Structure

Organize the codebase into self-contained modules or features.

* **Bad (Horizontal/Layered):**

    ```text
    /controllers
      auth_controller.ts
      cart_controller.ts
    /services
      auth_service.ts
      cart_service.ts
    ```

* **Good (Vertical/Feature):**

    ```text
    /features
      /auth
        auth_controller.ts
        auth_service.ts
        auth_model.ts
      /cart
        cart_controller.ts
        cart_service.ts
    ```

## 2. Screaming Architecture

* **Rule:** The top-level directory structure should scream the intent of the system, not the framework used.
* *Example:* Looking at the root folder, you should see `orders`, `inventory`, `users` (the Business), not `models`, `views`, `controllers` (the MVC Framework).

## 3. Shared Kernel

* Common utilities (Date formatters, HTTP wrappers) go into a `shared/` or `common/` folder.
* Features should minimize dependencies on each other. If Feature A needs Feature B, communicate via public Interfaces or Events.
